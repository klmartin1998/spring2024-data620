"Yes. An analysis of crashes in LA in 2022 showed the majority (56%) of all fatal or severe crashes happened on streets where we haven't implemented Mobility Plan safety improvements, despite those streets only making up a minority (25%) of total street milage in the City.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Measure HLA will mandate safety improvements on more than 2,500 miles of LA streets, including the most dangerous in the City. The City's High Injury Network represents the most dangerous streets in LA (6% of LA street miles where 65% of all pedestrian deaths and severe injuries happen) - HLA will add safety improvements to nearly the entirety of this network (93%). ",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"The Mobility Plan was designed to make streets more efficient by giving different modes of transportation dedicated space. This will reduce conflicts on our streets between different kinds of transportation allowing traffic to flow better. It will also make options that are space efficient like walking, taking the bus, or biking more viable - freeing up space on our roads.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
The Mobility Plan's original environmental document estimates that the number of vehicle miles traveled will go down 4.3% during peak hours by 2035 if the plan is built despite population increase.,Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"No. Currently, the City of Los Angeles has $700 Million in special funds that can only be spent every year on public works and transportation projects like repaving. The problem is almost all of that spending ignores the city's own plan, despite it being the cheapest time to add any improvements.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"HLA mandates planned improvements be included during repaving and routine street maintenance, allowing the Mobility Plan to be built for very few additional costs. It will save money over the status quo by preventing the need to tear up a street to add improvements at a later date. HLA will make the city work more efficiently so they don't do the work twice. ",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Additionally, ignoring the dangerous design of LA's streets is far more expensive than addressing them. Between 2015 and 2021 the City of LA invested $138 million into our Vision Zero program to build safe streets - over nearly the same time, a budget analysis showed StreetsLA and LADOT paid out $196 million in liability claims. We’re spending more settling safe street lawsuits than building safer streets.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
Some City officials have put forth unrealistic numbers for how much HLA will cost. Read specific commentary on those here. ,Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"The Mobility Plan was passed in 2015 by the City as a visionary document - but it didn't include an implementation plan. Without anything forcing the City to actually build the plan, bureaucracy, lack of political will, and poor department coordination has added an incredible amount of friction to getting things built or even prioritized. Measure HLA will force the city to coordinate between departments and implement the plan efficiently.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"At the current pace, the City will fully implement the the Mobility Plan in about 160 years. Measure HLA doesn't mandate a schedule - that's a decision for the city - but at our current rate of repaving the plan could be implemented in as few as 5 years but more realistically will be completed in 10-15 years. This means the Mobility Plan 2035 will be largely implemented by 2035.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
Implementing the Mobility Plan will speed up emergency responders. 300 miles of transit only lanes and hundreds of miles of safe street reconfigurations that add center turn lanes will allow emergency vehicles to speed past traffic. ,Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"The Mobility Plan Environmental Review Document found the same: ""Emergency vehicles would not be significantly impacted because California state law requires that drivers yield the right-of-way to emergency vehicles and remain stopped until the emergency vehicles have passed. Generally, multi-lane roadways allow the emergency vehicles to travel at higher speeds and permit other traffic to maneuver out of the path of the emergency vehicle. In addition, emergency service vehicles would be able to utilize the bus-only lanes when responding to an emergency which could help to improve travel times along the TEN corridors. Therefore, no impact related to emergency access would occur.""",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"In August 11, 2015, the Los Angeles City Council overwhelmingly approved Mobility Plan 2035 as an update to the City’s General Plan Transportation Element. The Mobility Plan lays a foundation for upgrades to more than 2,500 miles of city streets to better support movement for drivers, pedestrians, transit riders, and cyclists.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Specifically, the Mobility Plan prioritizes road safety – the very first plan objective is: “Vision Zero: Decrease transportation-related fatality rate to zero by 2035.”",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Unfortunately, the city has failed to execute on its promises, only implementing 5% of Mobility Plan mileage since 2015. At the current rate it will take 160 years to build our minimum network of safe streets in Los Angeles – meanwhile, people will die.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
Traffic related deaths are at an all time high; 336 people were killed just last year. Car crashes are the #1 killer of children in LA County.,Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
The LA Times reports “the traffic carnage in L.A. in 2022 outpaced national trends.”,Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Implementing the mobility plan is more critical than ever - it will unequivocally make our streets safer. Last year, more than half of crashes that resulted in deaths or severe injuries occurred on streets missing planned mobility plan safety improvements despite them making up less than 25% of streets in LA.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"While the Mobility Plan sets out a number of goals, Measure HLA focuses on the plan's six Mobility Networks as tangible and measurable expectations from the city.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
The promise of these completed networks is a city that’s easier to get around. Where moving through Los Angeles is safe and dignified for all users. Where kids can walk to school safely. Where hours aren’t wasted in traffic every day. Where taking the bus is quick and easy.,Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Each year the city of Los Angeles repaves around 500 miles of streets, or 6.6% of city roads. Each resurfacing requires LADOT to re-stripe the street afterwards - an opportunity to implement the Mobility Plan at minimal cost.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Measure HLA ties it to street repaving. We followed the examples of other cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; and Seattle, Washington. Every time a street is repaved, any corresponding Network Mobility Plan improvements must be implemented. We also put some common sense boundaries in place to make sure the city can still make quick road fixes for things like routine pothole repair, utility cuts, or emergency repairs.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"If Measure HLA passes, the majority of the Mobility Plan will be fully implemented in 5-15 years, instead of the 160 years of our current pace.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Measure HLA does two additional things. First, it mandates the city build an open data portal to share with the public Mobility Plan implementation progress within a year of being passed, including planned and installed improvements. It also has a clause to allow residents to sue the city for not following the new rules set out in this ordinance, and be awarded litigation costs to make sure any Angeleno can hold the city accountable without financial burden.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Pedestrian-Enhanced Districts (PEDs) include streets where pedestrian improvements are prioritized to provide safe and enjoyable walking connections to and from major destinations within communities. PEDs are selected based on safety, public health, equity, access, social, and/or economic benefits.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Examples of pedestrian enhancements include wayfinding signage, street trees, pedestrian-scale street lighting, enhanced crosswalks, automatic pedestrian signals, reduced crossing length (e.g., corner bulbouts and crossing refuge islands), sidewalk widening, and public seating areas.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Transit Enhanced Streets see significant public transit ridership. Over 260 miles of streets will receive bus upgrades to get riders out of traffic and move people across LA more efficiently. These include upgraded station amenities and dedicated bus lanes. These streets currently serve more than 400,000 transit riders each day (about half of Metro's ridership).",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"The improvements seen are significant. Including off-board fare collection, safe crossing within 300 feet of a station, signal priority, and improved stations. Comprehensive streets will see Two-way Center Running or curb adjacent exclusive corridor OR Physically Protected or Separate right-of-way (e.g., Orange Line) while Moderate Plus will see peak only lanes.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"The Bike Enhanced Network is a network of comfortable and safe protected bike lanes. These should be designed to accommodate all road users, from 8-80 in age. Protection may come in the form of plastic bollards, concrete curbs, or sidewalk level bike lanes.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"In addition, the installation of protected bicycle lanes would likely include signalization enhancements for bicycles along with turning-movement restrictions for motor vehicles.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"In the Mobility Plan 2035, the Bike Enhanced Network also includes Bike Paths such as the LA River path, however most of these are are not on streets, so only a few (like Alemeda) would be built by Measure HLA.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
Neighborhood Bike Streets are all ages bike facilities on neighborhood serving streets that provide connections within the Neighborhood Enhanced System. Covers approximately 50 miles.,Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"The Neighborhood Enhanced Network is a selection of streets that provide comfortable and safe routes for localized travel of slower-moving modes such as walking, bicycling, or other slow speed motorized means of travel. This network complements the Pedestrian Enhanced Districts and the Bicycle Enhanced Network by identifying non-arterial streets important to the movement of people who walk and bike.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
Improvements to Neighborhood streets include: Mini-roundabouts; Stop Signs on Cross-Streets; Curb Bulbouts and High-Visibility Crosswalks; Diagonal Diverter; Bicycle Signals at Major Intersection Crossings; Crossing Islands; or Bicycle Only Left Turn Pockets.,Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"The Vehicle Enhanced Network (VEN) identifies 79 miles of arterials, important to vehicular movement, that carry between 30,000 and 80,000 vehicles per day, traverse 10 miles or more through the City, and provide access to freeways and critical facilities.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"Enhancements typically include technology upgrades and peak-hour restrictions for parking and turning movements. Comprehensive enhancements can include improvements to access management, all-day lane conversions of parking, and all-day turning movement restrictions or permanent access control.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
"The Bike Lane Network is a selection of streets designated for painted bike lanes. These take up less road space, but provide less safety and comfort benefits than streets on the Bicycle Enhanced Network.",Yes on HLA,https://yesonhla.com/
